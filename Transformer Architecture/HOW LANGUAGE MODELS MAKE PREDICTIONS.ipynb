      "1️⃣  LEARNED PATTERNS (Training Phase)\n",

      "   • France's capital is Paris (factual knowledge)\n",
      "   • The grammatical pattern: \"X is Y\"\n",

      "   Through the 32 transformer layers:\n",

      "2. EMBEDDING\n",

      "3. TRANSFORMER LAYERS (32 layers)\n",

      "• Model assigns probability to EVERY possible word\n",
